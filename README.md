# testing-code
Repo for trying out code to test things.

Need a class to test. Check that flow of execution runs through
a certain method. This must be based on a few things.

1. An if statement that checks for something to be present in an
encompassing entity class of doom.
2. A static method that is initialised to return something always. Like
a property holding thing.
3. A static class that's a singleton. Constructor needs mocking. It returns something too, that needs to be set in the constructor.
4. Parameterized testing. Mention JUnit basic, but as it's not per test basis, use of junitparams stuff.
